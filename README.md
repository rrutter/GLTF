This is a simple GLTF viewer for c++ and opengl. only uses yyjson. no tinygltf or anything like that. It's not optimized for learning purposes. There are some helper methods in the GLTFBuffer (and other classes) that are not utilized.

Make sure glew is set to static and the assets / shaders are relative to your executable. 
C++ 20.
debug set for x86.
Libpng loads png images. 
Arrow keys move. 
esc key to quit. 
mouse left click drag to pan around.

There are remnants of my old 3d engine from 20 years ago in here to get it up and running quickly.
Do whatever you want with it.
